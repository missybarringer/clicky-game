## Overview
This is a web memory game app that a user clicks on an image & gets a point if they haven't clicked on that image before. If they click on the same image twice their high score is retained but the current score is reset to 0 and they have to start the game over.

### Technical specifications
This application demonstrates a full stack application using the MVC model (Model–View–Controller). HTML/CSS and React were used for the front end of the application. The backend of the application was implemented with Node, Express. The application's UI was broken down into components, component state management was handled, and user events were handled & stored on the client-side with React. All of the card components were created in the cards.json file, which contains the id, name, image & count=0 for each card which is imported into the App.js file. Once a user clicks on a card it's count is changed from 0 to 1 & the logic looks to see if that card has been clicked previously. If it has not the the score counter is incremented by 1, if it has already been clicked the High score is retained but the score is reset to 0 & the cards are shuffled again.
